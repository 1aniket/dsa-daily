## 💡 Key Learnings
1. **Keyboard Familiarity:** Early contest struggles were not due to problem difficulty but due to adapting to a **new keyboard**. This slowed typing and increased mistakes in early submissions.
2. **Steady Recovery:** Once adapted (~40 minutes in), problem-solving pace returned to normal, reflected in rating climb.
3. **Strong Areas:** Constructive & implementation problems.
4. **Weak Areas:** Number theory, bitwise XOR tricks, and range-based problems.

---

## ⏭ Next Steps
- Practice **number theory** (division properties, mod arithmetic).  
- Solve **bitwise XOR** problem sets to strengthen logic speed.  
- Drill range query & prefix sum problems.  
- Spend **15 minutes before contest** doing warm-up typing on the new keyboard.
